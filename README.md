# 🏠 House Rental System  

## 📌 Introduction  
The **House Rental System** is a university project that demonstrates how rental property management can be digitized. The system allows landlords to list apartments, tenants to rent them, and administrators to track occupancy.  

This project integrates **C++ backend logic** with a **web-based frontend** (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to simulate a rental management workflow.

## ✨ Features  
- **Dashboard:** Shows tenants, number of apartments, and occupancy status.  
- **Apartment Module:** Lists apartment details with rent, landlord name, and availability.  
- **Landlord Module:** Allows landlords to add their properties.  
- **Tenant Module:** Enables tenants to view and book available apartments.  
- **Interactive UI:** Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.  
- **Backend Logic:** Rental process simulated in `rental_system.cpp`.

## 🛠️ Technology Stack  
- **Frontend:**  
  - HTML5  
  - CSS3  
  - JavaScript (`app.js`)  

- **Backend (Simulation):**  
  - C++ (`cpp/rental_system.cpp`)  

- **Assets:**  
  - SVG illustrations for apartments (`assets/`)

## ⚙️ How to Run  

### 🔹 Run the Web Frontend  
1. Open the project folder:  
   ```
   House-Rental-System--main/
   ```
2. Double-click `index.html` to open it in your browser.  
3. Use the UI to explore apartments, landlords, and tenants.  

### 🔹 Run the C++ Backend (Simulation)  
1. Navigate to the `cpp/` folder.  
2. Compile the C++ file:  
   ```bash
   g++ rental_system.cpp -o rental_system
   ```  
3. Run the executable:  
   ```bash
   ./rental_system
   ```  
4. Follow on-screen instructions (e.g., adding apartments, tenants).
