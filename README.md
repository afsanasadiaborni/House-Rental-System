🏠 House Rental System
📌 Introduction
The House Rental System is a university project that demonstrates how rental property management can be digitized. The system allows landlords to list apartments, tenants to rent them, and administrators to track occupancy.

This project integrates C++ backend logic with a web-based frontend (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) to simulate a rental management workflow.

✨ Features
Dashboard: Shows tenants, number of apartments, and occupancy status.
Apartment Module: Lists apartment details with rent, landlord name, and availability.
Landlord Module: Allows landlords to add their properties.
Tenant Module: Enables tenants to view and book available apartments.
Interactive UI: Built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.
Backend Logic: Rental process simulated in rental_system.cpp.
